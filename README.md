<h1>Pitfall</h1>
</div>

This repository contains a clone of the popular Atari game ["Pitfall!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!). This game was created with pygame for a term project for my game design course a few years ago. Some of the features of the game include a store where you can buy things, music, powerups, and more. This repository is not maintained anymore -- forks are welcome, but I will not be committing anything to this.

This is only up so I have something to look back at in a few years :)

Happy coding.
